## 📋 Introduction

Welcome to the **People Analytics** repository created with Power BI! 
This project aims to provide, analyze, and visualize employee-related data such as retention, performance, satisfaction, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to **transform raw HR data into actionable business intelligence** that supports strategic decision-making across all levels of the organization.  
By combining **Power BI's visualization capabilities** with **Python's analytical power**, we aim to:

- **Identify Key Retention Drivers**: Analyze factors correlated with employee turnover to develop targeted retention strategies  
- **Measure Employee Engagement**: Track satisfaction metrics to understand workforce sentiment and improvement opportunities  
- **Optimize Performance Management**: Provide insights into performance patterns across departments, roles, and time periods  
- **Guide Compensation Strategy**: Analyze salary data relative to market rates and performance  
- **Enable Data-Driven HR Decisions**: Replace intuition with evidence-based approaches to workforce management  
- **Democratize HR Analytics**: Make complex workforce data accessible to stakeholders with varying technical expertise  
- **Predict Future Workforce Trends**: Utilize historical patterns to forecast key metrics and proactively address challenges
