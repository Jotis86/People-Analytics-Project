## 📊 Key Metrics

### 🔄 Turnover Rate

- **Definition**: The turnover rate measures the percentage of employees who leave the company during a specific period. It is a critical metric for understanding employee retention and the overall stability of the workforce.
- **Importance**: High turnover rates can indicate issues with employee satisfaction, management practices, or workplace culture. Conversely, low turnover rates suggest a stable and satisfied workforce.
- **Calculation**: Turnover Rate = (Number of terminations during a period / Total number of employees during that period) * 100
- **Example**: If a company has 10 terminations in a month and 200 employees, the turnover rate would be (10 / 200) * 100 = 5%.

### 📈 Net Promoter Score (NPS)

- **Definition**: The Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures employee loyalty and their likelihood to recommend the company as a great place to work. Originally used for customer satisfaction, NPS has been adapted to gauge employee engagement.
- **Importance**: NPS provides insights into employee satisfaction and loyalty. A high NPS indicates that employees are likely to recommend the company to others, reflecting a positive work environment.
- **Calculation**: NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
- **Groups**:
  - **Promoters**: Score 9-10. These employees are highly satisfied and likely to recommend the company.
  - **Passives**: Score 7-8. These employees are satisfied but not enthusiastic enough to be promoters.
  - **Detractors**: Score 1-6. These employees are dissatisfied and may negatively impact the company's reputation.
- **Example**: If 60% of employees are promoters, 30% are passives, and 10% are detractors, the NPS would be 60% - 10% = 50.

### 📉 Absenteeism Rate

- **Definition**: The absenteeism rate measures the percentage of work hours lost due to employee absences. It includes absences due to illness, personal reasons, and other causes.
- **Importance**: High absenteeism rates can indicate issues with employee health, workplace conditions, or job satisfaction. Monitoring absenteeism helps identify and address underlying problems.
- **Calculation**: Absenteeism Rate = (Hours not worked due to occasional causes, IT, or other reasons / Effective agreed hours) * 100
- **Effective Agreed Hours**: Agreed hours + Overtime hours - Hours not worked due to vacations and holidays
- **Example**: If employees collectively miss 500 hours in a month and the effective agreed hours are 10,000, the absenteeism rate would be (500 / 10,000) * 100 = 5%.
